# 🧠 MirrorMind – Real-Time Loop Detection Using Gaze & Expression

MirrorMind is a real-time behavior analysis system that tracks human facial expressions and gaze patterns to detect loop behaviors — such as zoning out, escaping reality, smiling, or freezing — while sitting in front of a screen. It leverages computer vision, face detection, and custom logic to classify these behaviors live.

## 🎥 Demo

Watch a real-time demo here: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/swasthiik](https://www.linkedin.com/in/swasthiik)

## 📌 Key Features

- 🧠 **Loop Detection Types**:
  - `Normal`: Stable presence and focus.
  - `FreezeLoop`: Stillness or lack of activity for extended time.
  - `EscapeLoop`: Sudden disappearance from the camera.
  - `ComparisonLoop`: Triggered by smiling (comparison thought).
  
- 👀 **Real-Time Gaze Tracking**
- 😊 **Smile Detection**
- ⚡ **Live Stream Behavior Updates** (no interruptions)
- 📈 **On-screen Visual Feedback** (loop state updates in real-time)
- 🧾 **Pattern Logging System** with timestamp, loop type, duration & context tag.

## 📂 Dataset

We built a 1000+ entry **human-labeled dataset** with fields like:
Timestamp	PatternDetected	LoopType	Duration	ContextTag	BreakSuggested
14:35:20	Looking away	EscapeLoop	00:10s	Overload	Yes
